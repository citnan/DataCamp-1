Adding a legend

Officers Deshaun, Mengfei, and Aditya have all been working with you to solve the kidnapping of Bayes.
Their supervisor wants to know how much time each officer has spent working on the case.

Deshaun created a plot of data from the DataFrames deshaun, mengfei, and aditya in the previous exercise.
Now he wants to add a legend to distinguish the three lines.

INSTRUCTIONS

Using the keyword label, label Deshaun's plot as "Deshaun".

Add labels to Mengfei's ("Mengfei") and Aditya's ("Aditya") plots.

Nothing is displaying yet! Add a command to make the legend display.


"""
# Officer Deshaun
plt.plot(deshaun.day_of_week, deshaun.hours_worked, label='Deshaun')

# Add a label to Aditya's plot

# Add a label to Mengfei's plot
